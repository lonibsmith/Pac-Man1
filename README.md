# Pac-Man1
The first Pac-Man assignment I finished was to create the appearance of Pac-Man moving across the screen while opening and closing its mouth. This was a great introduction to coding in an entertaining way by creating illusions for the user. I Have a lot of room for improvement on this assignment. the main way would be to create the stopper for the PacMan charachters at the end of the page, I am not sure how this didn't happen as I finished the assignment properly but it did not translate when I uploaded it. Hopefully I can update this readme file soon with the corrected version of the activity. I would also like to add the option to send ghosts onto the page (eventually).
